3 Trends that I have found in the data file.

#1: Females spend more on average than males do.  If the game can attract more female players,
there is a possiblility they will be the more profitable players
#2: Most of the purchases are being made by people in their early 20's.  However, players around 10 
years old, as well as upper 30's and lower 40's spend more on average.  They should try to attract those
demographics
#3: One of the top purchased items, "Pursuit, Cudgel of Necromancy" is also one of the lowest costing games.
If the developers were a little unscrupulous, they would raise the price of that item to increase revenue.
